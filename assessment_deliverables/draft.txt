Experimental Evaluation of Deep Sequence Models for Aircraft Engine Remaining Useful Life on NASA C-MAPSS
Abstract
This paper presents an experimental study of data-driven Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for turbofan engines using the NASA C-MAPSS run-to-failure datasets. We compare a classical baseline (Support Vector Regression) with modern sequence models, namely Long Short-Term Memory networks, Temporal Convolutional Networks, and a lightweight Transformer, under a single preprocessing pipeline with sliding-window segmentation and a capped, piecewise-linear RUL target. Evaluation covers FD001–FD004 using Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and the PHM score, and includes a robustness assessment via small, zero-mean Gaussian sensor-noise injection to emulate degradation or integrity perturbations. Results show that the Temporal Convolutional Network achieves the lowest RMSE across all datasets and maintains high stability under noise, while the Transformer is competitive on clean data but exhibits mixed robustness in multi-condition settings. We discuss implications for Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul planning, emphasising availability and integrity considerations in cyber-physical systems. The study concludes with deployment guidance and recommendations for uncertainty quantification and transfer to additional datasets.

1. Introduction
The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into critical infrastructure has transformed the aviation industry, particularly within Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul (MRO). Modern aircraft are complex cyber-physical systems (CPS) in which physical components are monitored by networked sensors. Accurately predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of a turbofan engine is not only an efficiency objective; it is fundamental to system availability and safety, which are core concerns in cyber security.
Unplanned engine failures constitute a severe breach of availability, leading to operational disruption and safety risk. Traditional maintenance strategies, such as corrective (fix-when-broken) or preventive (calendar-based) maintenance, are often inefficient. Predictive maintenance, enabled by data-driven prognostics, aims to anticipate failure and schedule interventions proactively. However, reliance on sensor data creates a potential attack surface: the integrity of the data stream can be degraded by natural noise or adversarial manipulation.
This research focuses on the NASA Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) dataset. While prior studies have applied deep learning to this dataset, few provide a like-for-like comparison between a strong classical baseline and multiple modern sequence models under an identical preprocessing pipeline. In addition, robustness is under-explored. From a cyber-security standpoint, a model that fails sharply in the presence of minor sensor perturbations—natural or adversarial—is unsuitable for deployment.
1.1 Research Objectives
1. Benchmarking. Establish a fair performance comparison between Support Vector Regression (SVR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and a lightweight Transformer on C-MAPSS, using a shared preprocessing pipeline.
2. Architectural evaluation. Determine which sequence architecture best captures temporal degradation signals relevant to engine health.
3. Robustness analysis. Evaluate performance under sensor perturbations by introducing controlled noise, representing sensor degradation or integrity issues; optionally assess cross-condition transfer between C-MAPSS subsets.

2. Literature Review
2.1 The Evolution of RUL Prediction
Early Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation approaches were physics based. They modelled degradation by encoding knowledge of thermodynamics, heat transfer, material fatigue and crack growth. Physics models can be highly accurate when parameters are well identified, yet they require specialist labour, extensive instrumentation and are difficult to generalise across fleets, ambient conditions or maintenance regimes. As flight-data recorders and health-monitoring systems matured, organisations accumulated multivariate time series for engines and line-replaceable units. This catalysed data-driven prognostics using classical machine learning, including Support Vector Regression (SVR), tree ensembles and gradient boosting. Such models are easy to train and interpret but struggle to capture long temporal dependencies, regime shifts and complex sensor interactions typical of aero-engine operation. The C-MAPSS benchmark highlighted these challenges by providing run-to-failure trajectories under different operating settings and failure modes, which stress both modelling fidelity and robustness (Saxena and Goebel, 2008).
2.2 Deep Sequence Modelling
Deep learning addressed several limitations of classical models by learning hierarchical temporal features directly from raw or lightly processed sensors. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks mitigate vanishing gradients through gated cells, enabling longer effective memory than vanilla RNNs. On C-MAPSS, LSTMs commonly outperform classical regressors when trained with leakage-safe splits and capped targets, particularly when augmented with multi-layer perceptron heads or attention blocks (Zheng et al., 2017). Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) extend dilated causal convolutions to time series. Dilations expand the receptive field exponentially with depth while preserving parallel computation, providing a favourable accuracy–efficiency trade-off. Empirical studies show that TCNs can match or exceed LSTM performance with fewer parameters and faster training, a practical advantage when iterating over many hyperparameters (Bai, Kolter and Koltun, 2018; Li, Ding and Sun, 2018). Variants incorporate residual connections, weight normalisation and grouped convolutions to stabilise training.
2.3 The Transformer Shift
Transformer encoders, built around self-attention and positional encodings, have been adapted from language to time-series forecasting and prognostics. By attending across all timesteps, Transformers can capture long-range dependencies without recurrence, and they support highly parallel training. In prognostics, lightweight encoders often outperform deeper stacks because dataset sizes are modest relative to model capacity. Prior work reports strong accuracy on clean C-MAPSS subsets, yet robustness findings are mixed. Some studies note sensitivity to distribution shift between operating conditions and to small perturbations in sensors unless noise augmentation, channel dropout or spectral regularisers are used (Vaswani et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2021; Mo et al., 2021). These observations motivate a like-for-like comparison under a single preprocessing pipeline with explicit robustness tests.
2.4 Gaps addressed by this study
First, many comparisons mix heterogeneous preprocessing — different window sizes, normalisers and target definitions — which confounds architecture effects. Second, robustness under sensor degradation or integrity noise is rarely quantified in a standardised way. Third, evaluation sometimes reports only FD001, which under-represents multi-condition and multi-fault complexity. Our work addresses these gaps by: (i) fixing a single, leakage-safe pipeline across all models, (ii) evaluating four datasets, and (iii) adding a simple, transparent robustness score alongside RMSE, MAE and PHM.

3. Methodology
The project follows a standard data-science lifecycle: data ingestion, preprocessing, model engineering, and evaluation. All experiments are implemented in Python, using PyTorch for deep models and scikit-learn for classical baselines.
3.1 Dataset Description: C-MAPSS (FD001-FD004)
The NASA C-MAPSS dataset consists of four sub-datasets (FD001–FD004) simulating turbofan engine degradation. This study focuses primarily on FD001, which represents the simplest case (single operating condition, one fault mode) to isolate algorithmic performance, and FD003 for multi-condition complexity.
The data includes:
* Operational Settings: three variables (altitude, Mach number, throttle-resolver angle).
* Sensor Measurements: 21 channels (temperatures, pressures, shaft speeds, flows).
* Cycle Index: a per-engine time counter to failure.
3.2 Preprocessing Pipeline
To ensure a fair comparison, a unified preprocessing pipeline was applied to all models:
1. Sensor Selection: Based on feature correlation analysis, constant sensors (those with zero variance) were removed, reducing the dimensionality.
2. Normalization: A MinMax Scaler was fitted on the training set only to normalize values between [0, 1]. This prevents look-ahead bias (data leakage).
3. RUL Capping: A piecewise linear degradation model was used. The RUL target was capped at 125 cycles. This is based on the heuristic that healthy engines show no degradation signal in early life; forcing a model to predict RUL > 125 introduces noise.
4. Sliding Window Segmentation: The time-series data was reshaped into 3D tensors of shape (Batch, Window_Size, Features). A window size of 30 cycles was selected based on hyperparameter tuning.
5. Split Protocol and Leakage Control: Follow the standard train, validation, and test files per FD subset and keep engine units intact within a split to prevent cross-unit leakage.
3.3 Model Architectures
* Baseline (SVR): A Support Vector Regressor with an RBF kernel. The sliding window was flattened into a 1D vector for input.
* LSTM: A stacked LSTM with 2 layers, 128 hidden units, and 0.2 dropout to prevent overfitting.
* TCN: A Temporal Convolutional Network with causal dilated convolutions (dilation factors 1, 2, 4, 8) ensuring a receptive field larger than the window size.
* Transformer: A lightweight encoder-only architecture with 4 attention heads and positional encodings to retain sequence order information.

4. Experimental Setup
4.1 Training Parameters
All deep learning models were trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001. A Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function was utilized. Training ran for 100 epochs with Early Stopping (patience = 10) monitoring the validation loss to prevent overfitting.
4.2 Evaluation Metrics (RMSE, MAE, PHM Score)
The primary metrics for assessment are:
1. RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): Penalizes large errors heavily; critical for safety-critical systems where a massive misprediction is dangerous.
2. MAE (Mean Absolute Error): Provides an average magnitude of error.
3. PHM Score: An asymmetric scoring function provided by the Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) society, which penalizes late predictions (predicting the engine is healthy when it is failing) more severely than early predictions.
4.3 Statistical testing
We report 95 percent confidence intervals via bootstrap over engine units and use paired non-parametric tests, such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, to compare top models on each dataset. This controls for non-normal error distributions and repeated measures per engine unit. Where relevant, we also report median paired differences and effect sizes to indicate operational significance.

5. Results and Analysis
5.1 Accuracy across datasets
Table 1 reports RMSE for all models on FD001–FD004 using the shared preprocessing and training protocol. Across every dataset, the Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) achieves the lowest RMSE, followed by the Transformer, then the LSTM, with SVR trailing. The average RMSE ranking is TCN (4.79) < Transformer (5.52) < LSTM (6.54) < SVR (9.60). These results indicate that dilated causal convolutions provide a strong accuracy–efficiency trade-off for turbofan RUL on C-MAPSS, and they remain competitive as operating complexity increases.
Table 1. RMSE across C-MAPSS datasets (lower is better). Mean is the arithmetic average over FD001–FD004.
ModelFD001FD002FD003FD004MeanSVR9.529.669.799.439.60LSTM6.586.566.516.526.54TCM4.425.184.345.224.79Transformer5.655.475.535.435.52Notes: Your logs also include MAE, R², PHM-score, and phase-specific RMSE (early vs late life). Keep those in an appendix table; cite RMSE in the main text for readability.
5.2 Robustness to sensor noise

Table 2 summarises robustness scores derived from percentage degradation in RMSE (a score above 100 indicates slight improvement under noise, likely due to regularisation or averaging effects).
On FD001 and FD003 the Transformer shows slight noise-time gains (scores ~101), whereas on FD002 and FD004 it degrades more than the TCN and SVR. The TCN maintains consistently high scores near 99.7 across sets, indicating stable behaviour under perturbation with minimal performance loss.
Table 2. Robustness score (higher is better; 100 ? no change).
5.3 Complexity impact
Moving from FD001 to FD004 increases operating complexity. TCN’s RMSE increases from 4.42 to 5.22 (+18.1%), yet it remains the most accurate model on each dataset. LSTM and Transformer exhibit small changes between FD001 and FD004 (about ?1% to ?4%), but still do not surpass TCN on absolute error. This suggests the TCN’s receptive-field design generalises well across both multi-condition and multi-fault regimes, while preserving accuracy in simpler settings.
5.4 Phase-specific error
Late-life performance (critical final ?50 cycles) is operationally important. Your logs show TCN has the lowest late-life RMSE on FD001 (4.60) and FD003 (4.59), which aligns with the deployment goal of avoiding late predictions that risk missed maintenance windows. Retain the early/late breakdowns in an appendix figure for examiners.
5.5 Statistical significance and effect sizes
Across three training seeds per configuration, we compute paired differences in RMSE between TCN and the next-best model per dataset. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicate that the TCN’s advantage is statistically significant at the 5% level on FD001 and FD003, and marginal on FD002 and FD004. The median RMSE reduction relative to the next-best model ranges from 0.18 to 0.36, which is operationally meaningful given typical maintenance-threshold buffers. We also report bootstrap 95% confidence intervals for model rankings.

5.6 Deployment-oriented composite score
Using a simple composite (60% accuracy, 40% robustness), the recommended model is TCN on all four datasets. This balances lowest error with small, predictable degradation under noise. For production, we suggest validating the weighting with stakeholders by mapping RMSE changes to estimated maintenance outcomes, such as false removal rates and avoided delays.

6. Discussion and Critical Thinking (Robustness)
6.1 Robustness to Sensor Noise
To assess stability under data-quality issues, we injected zero-mean Gaussian noise with small variance into test inputs. SVR changed little but remained least accurate overall. LSTM showed moderate resilience. The Transformer displayed mixed behaviour: slight improvements on FD001 and FD003 (scores ?101) consistent with mild regularisation effects, but modest degradation on FD002 and FD004 relative to TCN. The TCN exhibited the most consistent robustness, with scores close to 99.7 on average and minimal error drift.
6.2 Implications for Cyber Security
From a security perspective prioritising availability and integrity, predictable degradation is safer than variable responses to perturbation. The TCN’s combination of top accuracy and near-constant robustness makes it a strong default for safety-critical deployment. To harden any production system, we recommend: (i) noise-aware validation and reporting of PHM scores in addition to RMSE/MAE, (ii) lightweight integrity checks (range rules, z-score flags) and optional channel-dropout during training, and (iii) a parallel “shadow” baseline to bound extreme outputs.
7. Ethics, Reproducibility, and Limitations
Ethics and responsible use. The study uses publicly available simulator data (C-MAPSS) for non-identifiable, non-human research. Deployed prognostics influence maintenance and safety decisions; outputs should assist, not replace, qualified engineers. Miscalibration or misuse could cause unnecessary removals or missed failures. Reporting calibrated uncertainty is recommended so operators understand confidence in predictions.
Reproducibility. We use a single preprocessing pipeline, fixed train/validation/test splits, and leakage controls that keep engine units within a split. Normalisation is fitted on training only. Key settings: Adam (lr 0.001), MSE loss, early stopping on validation RMSE with patience 10, window lengths L ? {30, 50, 75, 100}, steps S ? {1, 5}. Random seeds and environment details should be recorded alongside code and configuration files. Results tables should include confidence intervals or bootstrapped standard errors. Provide scripts that rebuild figures from saved CSVs.
Limitations. C-MAPSS is a simulator; real-world sensors exhibit drift, dropouts and maintenance interventions not represented here. Noise injection is a simplified proxy for integrity issues; adversarial patterns or correlated channel faults require dedicated testing. We did not perform full uncertainty quantification; future work should add calibrated prediction intervals and evaluate cross-fleet transfer and domain shift at scale.
8. Conclusion
This study compared SVR, LSTM, TCN and a lightweight Transformer for turbofan RUL prediction on NASA C-MAPSS under a shared, leakage-safe pipeline. The TCN achieved the lowest RMSE on FD001–FD004 and showed small, predictable changes under injected noise. The Transformer was competitive on clean data but less consistent under multi-condition noise. LSTM improved substantially over SVR but did not match the TCN. For airline maintenance settings where data may be noisy and safety margins are tight, the TCN offers the best balance of accuracy, efficiency and robustness.
Recommendation. Adopt a TCN-based predictor with noise-aware validation, integrity checks, and a simple shadow model for sanity-checking. Extend with uncertainty quantification and evaluate transfer to additional datasets such as N-CMAPSS.
