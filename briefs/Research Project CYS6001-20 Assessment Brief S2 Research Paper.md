# S2: Research Paper

    Word Count: 4000 (+/- 10%)

## 

## The Brief

Your project culminates in your Research Paper that addresses a research question developed in consultation with your tutor(s) in the early stages of the module. You should choose a research topic that you are genuinely interested in within the domain of cyber security.

Your report will describe the research work you have done. It will describe the context for the investigation (referring to existing knowledge), discuss the research process itself (methodology and production), and discuss your findings.

## Deliverables

The deliverables for this assignment are as follows:

* A structured report of 4000 words (+/- 10%) .

The report should be formatted as outlined below.

* Front cover- with the report title on it, but not your name. The assignments are marked anonymously.

* Abstract: summarising the main conclusions of your report.

* Contents page.

* Introduction \- setting the scene.

* A series of main headings, followed by paragraphs of text. You can use bullet points to summarise material, but be careful not to overuse them.

* Conclusions \- drawing together your main points and then suggesting what they mean when take as a whole.

We will discuss relevant sections to include in the report during our sessions.

## Submission

##

Please follow the submission instructions below. Work that is submitted incorrectly may not be accepted or could incur a points penalty.

Before submitting have you…

* Spell-checked and grammar-checked your work? Please make an appointment with

  the [Writing and Learning Centre](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/library/writing-and-learning-centre/) [(https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/library/writing-and-learning-](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/library/writing-and-learning-centre/) [centre/)](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/library/writing-and-learning-centre/) or speak to your tutor if you are experiencing challenges in this area.

* Formatted your written work to the specification below?

* Referenced all sources of information accurately? Please refer

  to [www.citethemrightonline.com](http://www.citethemrightonline.com/) [(http://www.citethemrightonline.com)](http://www.citethemrightonline.com/) for guidance.

## Format

All written work must conform to university styling and submission guidelines. They must:

* Contain appropriate in-text citation that supplies an accurate list of references.

* Be accurate in referencing. See [Bath Spa guidelines](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/library/researching-and-referencing/)

   [(https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/library/researching-and-referencing/)](https://www.bathspa.ac.uk/library/researching-and-referencing/) and the Harvard system described at [www.citethemrightonline.com](http://www.citethemrightonline.com/) [(http://www.citethemrightonline.com/)](http://www.citethemrightonline.com/).

* Be accurate in spelling and paragraphing.

Word counts

Written assessments must be within a tolerance of \+/-10% of the word count stated on briefs. For example, an assessment with a specified word count of 2,000 words must be in the range of 1,800 to 2,200 words.

Submissions that do not fall within word count limits of \+/-10% may be penalised for not meeting the constraints of the assessment. Furthermore, written pieces that fall below the minimum word count (-10%) may lack the detail required by the assessment.

## Marking Criteria

Assessment S2: Research Paper will be marked against the following criteria:

1. Writing (structure, flow, precision, spelling, grammar) \- 15%.

2. Research Analysis (Review & Analysis of the topic) \- 70%.
