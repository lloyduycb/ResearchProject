S1: Lightning Talk

Word Count: The equivalent of a 5-minute summary of your research.

## The Brief

You are to provide a 5 minute presentation of your research. The purpose is to showcase the essence of your research.

Lightning talks are a very short time in which to make an impact, so you should look to explain:

* key questions your research aimed to address (and why);

* what you did (to answer your research question);

* what answers did you actually find;

* why the outcome is important (why your research findings matter).

You will also be asked questions about your research from the assessors.

## Deliverables

The deliverables for this assignment are as follows:

* A presentation of approximately 5 minutes length (7 minutes maximum), plus additional time for questions.

* Presentation slides and poster.

## Submission

Please follow the submission instructions below. Work that is submitted incorrectly may not be accepted or could incur a points penalty.
