# Results (Exclude raw data but maybe we want to keep specific plots? 
# Usually derived data is ignored, but user wants to show results.
# I'll Un-ignore specific images if needed, but for now let's keep it safe or 
# maybe allow the results folder if it's not too huge.
# The user wants to SHOW drafts in repo? No, "not show the drafts".
# So drafts should be ignored.)
